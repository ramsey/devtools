## About

I created this [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) plugin because I got tired of
making changes to development tools and scripts in my repositories, only to find
I liked the change so much, I now needed to apply it to all my repositories.
This is an effort to consolidate and simplify.

These tools might not be for you, and that's okay.

Maybe these tools help a lot, but you have different needs. That's also okay.
You may create your own devtools, requiring
[ramsey/devtools-lib](https://github.com/ramsey/devtools-lib) (the library code
behind this plugin), to extend and add to these tools, creating your own
Composer plugin.

Of course, if you want to help improve these tools, I welcome your contributions.
Feel free to open issues, ask about or request features, and submit PRs. I can't
wait to see what you come up with.

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating in this project and its community, you are expected to
uphold this code.

## Installation

Install this package as a development dependency using
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

``` bash
composer require --dev ramsey/devtools
```

## Usage

This package is a Composer plugin. This means Composer recognizes that it
provides custom functionality to your `composer` command. After installation,
type `composer list`, and you'll see a lot of new commands that this plugin
provides.

``` bash
composer list
```

### Add a Command Prefix

The commands this plugin provides are all intermingled with the rest of the
Composer commands, so it may be hard to find them all. We have a way to group
them by command namespace, though. Open `composer.json` and add a
`ramsey/devtools.command-prefix` property to the `extra` section. You may use
any prefix you wish.

``` json
{
    "extra": {
        "ramsey/devtools": {
            "command-prefix": "my-prefix"
        }
    }
}
```

Now, when you type `composer list` (or just `composer`), you'll see a section
of commands that looks like this:

```
 my-prefix
  my-prefix:analyze:all           Runs all static analysis checks.
  my-prefix:analyze:phpstan       Runs the PHPStan static analyzer.
  my-prefix:analyze:psalm         Runs the Psalm static analyzer.
  my-prefix:build:clean           Cleans the build/ directory.
  my-prefix:build:clean:all       Cleans the build/ directory.
  my-prefix:build:clean:cache     Cleans the build/cache/ directory.
  my-prefix:build:clean:coverage  Cleans the build/coverage/ directory.
  my-prefix:changelog             Support for working with Keep A Changelog.
  my-prefix:license               Checks dependency licenses.
  my-prefix:lint:all              Runs all linting checks.
  my-prefix:lint:fix              Auto-fixes coding standards issues, if possible.
  my-prefix:lint:pds              Validates project compliance with pds/skeleton.
  my-prefix:lint:style            Checks for coding standards issues.
  my-prefix:lint:syntax           Checks for syntax errors.
  my-prefix:test:all              Runs linting, static analysis, and unit tests.
  my-prefix:test:coverage:ci      Runs unit tests and generates CI coverage reports.
  my-prefix:test:coverage:html    Runs unit tests and generates HTML coverage report.
  my-prefix:test:unit             Runs unit tests.
```

You can also list commands by command prefix with `composer list my-prefix`.

### Extending or Overriding ramsey/devtools Commands

Maybe the commands ramsey/devtools provides don't do everything you need, or
maybe you want to replace them entirely. The configuration allows you to do
this!

Using the `ramsey/devtools.commands` property in the `extra` section of
`composer.json`, you may specify any command (*without* your custom prefix, if
you've configured one) as having other scripts to run, in addition to the
command's default behavior, or you may override the default behavior entirely.

Specifying additional scripts works exactly like
[writing custom commands](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md#writing-custom-commands)
in `composer.json`, but the location is different. Everything you can do with
a custom Composer command, you can do here because they're the same thing.

``` json
{
    "extra": {
        "ramsey/devtools": {
            "command-prefix": "my-prefix",
            "commands": {
                "lint:all": {
                    "script": "@mylint"
                },
                "test:all": {
                    "script": [
                        "@mylint",
                        "@phpbench"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "scripts": {
        "mylint": "parallel-lint src tests",
        "phpbench": "phpbench run"
    }
}
```

In this way, when you run `composer my-prefix:lint:all` or `composer my-prefix:test:all`,
it will  execute the default behavior first and then run your additional commands.
To  override the default behavior so that it doesn't run at all and only your
scripts run, specify the `override` property and set it to `true`.

``` json
{
    "extra": {
        "ramsey/devtools": {
            "commands": {
                "lint:all": {
                    "override": true,
                    "script": "parallel-lint src tests"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
